## The MEAN Stack

This is the name given to the full-javascript web development stack using the following 4 core technologies :

 - **MongoDB** for the data management
 - **ExpressJS** for the server-side web application development
 - **AngularJS** for the browser-side interactions
 - **NodeJS** for the run-time environment
 
We add the following for the application :

 - *ElasitcSearch* for full-text search of the data (alternatively consider Algolia).

### Notes on using the MEAN stack

 - ExpressJS `require` and `module.exports` : this is the way to pass data in Express JS.
 - `app.use()` order of statements in `app.js` file for ExpressJS.
 - Passing data from `ExpressJS` to `AngularJS`.
 - Spinning up the nodeJS runtime : `node app.js`.
 - Rendering data from server-side (using ExpressJS) vs browser-side (using AngularJS).
 - mongoose and connection to MongoDB.
 - AngularJS object passing between services and modules and how they bind to HTML (which in turn can be controlled by ExpressJS).
 - Layout.ejs is the default layout name.
